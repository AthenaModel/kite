<manpage {kiteutils(n) os(n)} "OS Abstraction Layer">

<section SYNOPSIS>

<pre>
package require kiteutils <version>
namespace import ::kiteutils::*
</pre>

<itemlist>

<section DESCRIPTION>

os(n) provides an OS abstraction layer for Kite and other projects.
The layer is not concerned with the architectural details of the
OS (e.g., 32 vs. 64 bit), but with the details of interacting with
the OS, e.g., file locations, file naming conventions, and
ways to make things happen.

In particular, os(n) defines a number of "flavors" that represent distinct
OS-interaction patterns: <b linux>, <b osx>, and <b windows>.


<section COMMANDS>

<deflist>

<defitem "os appdir" {os appdir}>

Returns the name of an OS-specific root directory for creating application 
data directories (e.g., for preference files), or "" if there is no 
specific place.

How to use this information is up to the application's developer.   On
Windows, for example, it's customary to create an organization
subdirectory, and then within that the application's own data subdirectory.
On Linux, it's customary to simply create an application-specific "dot
file" or  "dot directory" in the user's home directory.

<defitem "os exefile" {os exefile <i name>}>

Adds ".exe" to the name of an executable file on those platforms that require it.

<defitem "os flavor" {os flavor}>

Returns the "flavor" of the operating system, one of
<b linux>, <b osx>, or <b windows>, which is specific enough for most of
Kite's needs.  (To find the actual architecture, use 
<b>platform::identify</b> in the standard platform(n) package.)

<defitem "os flavors" {os flavors}>

Returns a list of the flavors recognized by os(n).

<defitem "os name" {os name}>

Returns a prettier version of the flavor, e.g., "Windows".

<defitem "os pathfind" {os pathfind <i name>}>

Looks for the named executable on the user's <b PATH>, returning
the normalized path on success and "" on failure.

<defitem "os username" {os username}>

Attempt to determine the user name by querying the environment.  Returns
"" if the user name cannot be determined.

</deflist>

<section ENVIRONMENT>

Requires Tcl 8.6 or later.
