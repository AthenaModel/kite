# Project TODO List

* Document the project.kite file syntax and semantics.
* Add content for "kite help _command_"
* Add library project tree template.

At this point Kite becomes useful.

* Support the "app" build target.
  * Add "require" project.kite command, to indicate the app's teapot dependencies.
* Later add "teacup" interactions related to teapot dependencies.
